# Assignment3
* Add regularization to your CFAR-10 model (Dropout, L1, and L2)
* Find out how deep the model can be and still improving
* Draw confusion matrix
* Use five different optimizers and compare their results and convergence time (SGD, Adam, Adagrad, Adadelta, RMSprop)
* Use three different activation functions (ReLu, Tanh, Sigmoid)
* Draw all of your experiments in tensorboard or wandb!
* Write softmax loss and Hinge loss without using torch.nn
