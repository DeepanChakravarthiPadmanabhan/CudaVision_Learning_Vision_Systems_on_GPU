# Assignment 1
* Set Jupyter server in your home account so that you can use it remotely (Optional due to Covid-19!)
* Build 2 layer network for Logistic Regression Classifier using pure python/numpy
  * Input data x : 20 x 784 (20 is the batch size)
  * label y : 20 x 10

  * Weight Variable W with random_normal initialization

  * Bias variable b with zeros

  * Use softmax activation => softmax(x.W+b)

  * Use OneHot encoding and MSE loss! Not the best way for classification but just for practice

  * Train the model on MNIST

  * PS: If you dont know how to start see this: http://iamtrask.github.io/2015/07/12/basic-python-network/
