# Assignment6
* Write a Variational Convolutional AutoEncoder on CFAR10 + Add denoising to the model
* Use the latent space for CFAR10 classification
* Write Adam optimizer in PyTorch (without using nn.Adam!)
* Write a Convolutional Variational Auto Encoder and use PixelShuffle instead of TransposeConv
* To do your previous assignment (robot classification) on latent space of a trained CAE
