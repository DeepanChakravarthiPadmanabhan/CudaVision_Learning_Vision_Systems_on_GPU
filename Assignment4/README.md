# Assignment4
* Train a CNN for CIFAR-10 with the best hyperparameters possible
* Visualize activations after each Conv filter
* Visualize kernel of each Conv filter
* Which one is working better in CIFAR-10, MaxPooling or AvgPooling or concatination of both
* Take a Convolutional layer with the appropriate kernel size and load the trained weight/bias into an FC layer (You should think about in what situation you can have convolutional layer like FC layer)
* Add a self-attention layer to your CIFAR-10 model!
